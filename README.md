# Map Convertor
This is a map convertor that takes in a text based 2D map, the characters that represent open space, and the width of the map, and returns new 2D text based map where "1" is an obstacle and "0" is open space.

If you don't really care about the code, then the pre-compiled exe (not guaranteed to be updated) can be found in the Debug folder. If you subscribe to a religon other then windows..... CMake is your friend! (I didn't want to include a compiled file for linux, as unlike the .exe file located in debug, it is likely to become outdated)
