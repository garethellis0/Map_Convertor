# Map Convertor
This is a map convertor that takes in a text based 2D map, the characters that represent open space, and the width of the map, and returns new 2D text based map where "1" is an obstacle and "0" is open space.

If you just want to make sure it works, or if you want some examples of pre-formatted maps, they can be found in the Map_Convertor folder (I used them for debugging).
